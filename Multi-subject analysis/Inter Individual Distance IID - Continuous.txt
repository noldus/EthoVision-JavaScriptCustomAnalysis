// Inter Individual Distance (IID) - Continuous

// This ode calculates the average distance of each subject to all the other subjects and stores a value for each sample
// Assumptions: At least two subjects, distance is based on the center points
// IID is calculated for each focal subject
// Unit is mm

// Enter the names of the subjects as they are defined in the Experiment Settings in your experiment
// Delete the names of subjects not used e.g. Subjects 5 to 7
// Add more subject names if necessary e.g. "Subject 8"
