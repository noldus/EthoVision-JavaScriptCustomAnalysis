// Activity (Pixel change) - Continuous

// This is a javaScript continuous parameter which provides the percentage of pixels
// that change their gray scale value between the previous sample and the current sample
// It is expressed as percentage of the area of the Arena and is equal to EthoVision XT Activity
// Whether a pixel changes its gray scale value depends on the Activity settings in your experiment
